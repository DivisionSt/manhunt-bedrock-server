# Minecraft Manhunt (Bedrock)
**https://mcpedl.com/minecraft-manhunt/ - Add-on link**

Latest Add-On Version: **1.6.1**

## Description
You activate the Add-on on a brand new world. There is one Speedrunner and one Hunter (or more). You should play this game in complete **survival vanilla Minecraft**. 

**The Speedrunner's goal** is to beat Minecraft, if they beat Minecraft or before the timer ends which you haven't got killed by hunter(s), the speedrunner wins. If the speedrunner died, they lose instantly.

**The Hunter's goal** is to kill the speedrunner by the end of beating Minecraft or the timer ends. Hunter(s) has/have a compass which can track the speedrunner. Remember the compass works only in the overworld dimension, or last location if the speedrunner is in the Nether. Also a reminder, hunter has unlimited life, each time they died they will receive a compass once they respawn.
